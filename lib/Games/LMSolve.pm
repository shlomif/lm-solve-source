# You can think of this module as a Factory[1] for the solver classes.
# It reads the -g/--game/--preset [variant name] command line option
# and determines which class to instantize based on it.
#
# Note that it does not touch the other command line options so the
# GetOptions() called by the main() function of the class will be
# able to process them.

=head1 NAME

Games::LMSolve - base class for LM-Solve solvers factories

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package MyReg;

    use Games::LMSolve;

    @ISA = qw(Games::LMSolve);

    use MyPuzzle::Solver;

    sub register_all_solvers
    {
        my $self = shift;

        $self->register_solvers({ 'mypuzzle' => "MyPuzzle::Solver"});

        $self->set_default_variant("mypuzzle");

        return 0;
    }

    package main;

    my $r = MyReg->new();
    $r->main();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is a registry of L<Games::LMSolve::Base>-derived solvers. It
maps variants IDs to the classes. To use it, sub-class it and over-ride
the register_all_solvers() function. In it use register_solvers while
passing a reference to a hash that contains the variant IDs as keys
and the class names, or constructor functions as values.

You can also use set_default_variant() to set the default variant.

After all that, in your main script initialize a registry object, and
call the main() method.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

The constructor. Accepts the following named arguments:

=over 4

=item * 'default_variant'

The default variant for the registry to be used in case one is not specified.

=back

=cut

sub new
{
    my $class = shift;

    my $self = {};

    bless $self, $class;

    $self->_initialize(@_);

    return $self;
}

sub _initialize
{
    my $self = shift;

    my %args = @_;

    $self->{'games_solvers'} = {};

    $self->register_all_solvers();

    if (exists($args{'default_variant'}))
    {
        $self->set_default_variant($args{'default_variant'});
    }

    return 0;
}

=head2 $registry->set_default_variant($variant)

Sets the default variant to $variant.

=cut

sub set_default_variant
{
    my $self = shift;

    my $variant = shift;

    $self->{'default_variant'} = $variant;

    return 0;
}

=head2 $self->register_solvers(\%solvers)

Adds the %solvers map of names to class names to the registry.

=cut

sub register_solvers
{
    my $self = shift;

    my $games = shift;

    $self->{'games_solvers'} = { %{$self->{'games_solvers'}}, %$games};

    return 0;
}

=head2 $self->register_all_solvers()

To be sub-classes to register all the solvers that the registry wants
to register. Does nothing here.

=cut

sub register_all_solvers
{
    my $self = shift;

    return 0;
}

=head2 $self->main()

the main function that handles the command line arguments and runs the
program.

=cut

sub main
{
    my $self = shift;

    my $variant = $self->{'default_variant'};
    my $help = 0;
    my $man = 0;

    Getopt::Long::Configure('pass_through');
    GetOptions(
        "g|game=s" => \$variant,
        'help|h|?' => \$help,
        'man' => \$man
        ) or pod2usage(2);

    pod2usage(1) if $help;
    pod2usage(-exitstatus => 0, -verbose => 2) if $man;

    if (!exists($self->{'games_solvers'}->{$variant}))
    {
        die "Unknown game variant \"$variant\"";
    }

    my $class = $self->{'games_solvers'}->{$variant};
    my $game;
    if (ref($class) eq "CODE")
    {
        $game = $class->();
    }
    else
    {
        $game = $class->new();
    }
    $game->main();
}
